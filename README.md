# Lesson-5 , "form handling"

- Check the Form component for form handling.
- on React textarea works like input field you have to give value. Instead of writing everything between the opening and closing tag.

```
// on html
 <textarea > This where we give text area value </textarea>

// on React
 <textarea value="this is where we give the value" />

```

- for input type checkbox use e.target.checked to change the value.
