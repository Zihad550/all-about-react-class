# Lesson-7, "Composition vs Inheritance"

- Inheritance: When a class inherit or gets somethings from his parent class. Like we use **extends React.Component** by doing this we can use render, state and setState. They are properties of React.Component but we can use them in our class component by inheritance.

- Inheritance is integral part of OOP. But React wants us to use composition instead of inheritance. We use inheritance one time on a react class component when we do **extends React.Component**.
