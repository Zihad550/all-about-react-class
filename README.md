# React Class Component

- React.Component:
  To use class component as **tags** use extends React.Component

- render method:
  React by default calls the render function. You have to write the return keyword and all the things you want to return inside it.

- props:
  To get props in a class component you have to use **this.props**, this.props== gives all props, this.props.children = gives everything inside the tag
